          We set out to build a modern, dynamic shop for parents and carers of babies and young children. As it stands, the definitive online shop for toys is Amazon - offering a wide variety of products with an easy to navigate and most importantly, intuitive shopping experience.
<br></br>
<br></br>
However, as more and more people are raising concerns over the ethics of a site like this, we felt that families, parents and carers deserve an ethical, humanistic and efficient place to browse potential purchases, without losing out on the benefits and quality of life features that come with massive online shops such as Amazon.
<br></br>
<br></br>
With an AI assistant, robust filters and a clean, lightweight UI, Blissful Beginnings is your one-stop-shop for all your Baby and Child needs.
